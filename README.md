manage state with contextAPI

(Create an empty object to represent the initial state (optional):

const getDefaultCart = () => {
})
##### Context API allows data to be passed through a component tree without manual prop passing, making data sharing between components easier.
##### You can also consider using Redux for state management as an alternative to Context API
